# Springboot-kafka
Real-Time Data Streaming with Apache Kafka & Spring Boot
Description:
Designed and implemented a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spring Boot, ingesting live edit events from Wikimedia and storing them in a database. Built a producer-consumer microservices architecture to efficiently handle and process high-throughput data.

Key Technologies:
🔹 Apache Kafka (Producer & Consumer)
🔹 Spring Boot
🔹 REST API (Wikimedia stream)
🔹 PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for storage)
🔹 Docker & Kubernetes (for deployment)

💡 Highlights:
✔️ Implemented a Kafka Producer to ingest real-time Wikimedia edit events.
✔️ Built a Kafka Consumer to process and store streamed data efficiently.
✔️ Designed a scalable microservices architecture for real-time data processing.
✔️ Optimized performance with Kafka Streams and Schema Registry (optional, if used).
✔️ Developed a basic UI visualization for live-streamed data changes.
